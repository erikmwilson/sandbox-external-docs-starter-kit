VMware licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide your own VMware licenses or purchase VMware licenses from
Rackspace. Licenses can't be a mixture of your own licenses and licenses
purchased from Rackspace. All licenses must be from one source.

VMware licenses purchased from Rackspace for RPC-VMware are installed during
provisioning. Customer-supplied VMware licenses are applied by Rackspace when
your private cloud is provisioned. Before Rackspace applies a license, a VMware
installation uses an evaluation license.

Windows OS licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide your own Windows OS licenses or purchase Windows Data Center
license from Rackspace. If you purchase host-based OS licensing from Rackspace,
it can be activated with the Rackspace KMS server. Use the instructions
provided by your Rackspace account team. The Rackspace KMS server is accessible
only by systems hosted with Rackspace.

Red Hat OS licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide your own Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS licenses or purchase a Red
Hat Enterprise Linux host-based license from Rackspace. If you purchase
host-based OS licensing from Rackspace, it can be activated with the Rackspace
RHN server. Use the instructions provided by your Rackspace account team. The
Rackspace RHN server is accessible only by systems hosted with Rackspace.

Application licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must provide all application licensing.
