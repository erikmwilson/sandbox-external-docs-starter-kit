Patching and upgrading (example)
================================

Rackspace will periodically patch or upgrade the various Rackspace-provided
services in your Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware (RPC-VMware)
environment. These services will be patched or upgraded to the most recent
Rackspace-supported version as needed and to address critical vulnerabilities.

Rackspace will try to obtain your consent before patching or upgrading the
environment to ensure that actions are performed at a convenient time for
you. This process will not require any scheduled downtime for virtual systems
deployed by you in your environment, but it might temporarily impact the
availability of the various user interfaces and APIs of the RPC-VMware
services. The patching or upgrade of hosts might affect the performance of
virtual systems deployed by you in your environment if the patch or upgrade
requires a host to be restarted. Performance should return to normal when
host patching or upgrading is complete.
