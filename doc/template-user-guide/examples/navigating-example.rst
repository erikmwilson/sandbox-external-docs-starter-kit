Resource organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several features help you organize, find, and efficiently manage your
resources:

-  **Tags** are customized labels that you can add to any of the resources in
   your cloud infrastructure.

-  **Filters** enable you to find all resources that share the following
   common properties: tag, status, image, RAM, region, or type.

   The list of filters is located at the left side of the control panel. When
   you create and tag resources, the list is automatically populated. When you
   select a check box next to a filter, the list of resources shows only the
   matching ones.

-  **Search**  gives you another method for locating any asset. Enter part of
   the asset name, tag, or IP address in the search field in the upper-right
   corner of any asset listing.

Administrative actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The control panel provides a variety of ways to perform administrative tasks.
Whether you're looking at a list of assets or a detailed view of a single
asset, you don't need to leave your current location to perform a task; every
task you might want to perform is accessible right where you are.

-  **Gear icon**: The gear icon to the left of a resource name which provides
   a drop-down menu with all available actions for that resources. The actions
   gear is always part of every list, whether it is a list of servers, files,
   or load balancers.

-  **Actions menu**: When you're looking at the details of a specific resource,
   you'll find the **Actions** menu in the upper-right corner of the page.

-  **Edit pencils and options**: You can also edit the existing setting for
   many resources by clicking the pencil icon or option text that appears next
   to the resource description.

-  **Pop-up boxes**:  When you perform an administrative action on a resource,
   a pop-up dialog box enables you to modify the settings or perform an action
   without taking you to another page.

Access to other control panels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reach the Rackspace Intelligence interface and more by selecting the
option from the **More Products** drop-down menu at the top left of the
Cloud Control Panel.
