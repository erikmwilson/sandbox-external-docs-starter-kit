Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware User Guide
====================================================

Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware (RPC-VMware) is a single-tenant
private cloud that enables you to conveniently transition or extend your
on-premises VMware workloads into the hosted VMware environment at Rackspace.
It is built on top of the same VMware virtualization and software-defined
technologies that you use in your data centers: VMware vSphere®, NSX™, vSAN™,
and the vRealize® Suite.

This guide is your primary resource for information related to RPC-VMware, such
as getting started, using, working with add-on components, and getting help.
