Accessing the dashboard (example)
=================================

To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a `Rackspace Cloud
account <https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud>`_ and you must be logged in to
the `Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`_ for that
account. Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.

Access Rackspace Intelligence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Go to the `Rackspace Intelligence dashboard <https://intelligence.rackspace.com/>`_.

    If you're not already logged in, Rackspace Intelligence redirects you to
    the Cloud Control Panel login page.

2.  Log in with your cloud account user name and password. If your account is
    configured to require it, you might need to perform additional steps to
    `log in with multi-factor authentication <https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel>`_.

See different aspects of the same entities in the control panel and dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you are logged in, the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard can
display information about some of the same entities that you can see in
the Cloud Control Panel. For example, if you use the Cloud Control Panel
to create a cloud server, you can then use the Rackspace Intelligence
interface to visualize the status of that server.

You can switch between the interfaces as follows:

- From the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard, click the
  **Rackspace Intelligence** menu at the top of the window and select
  **Rackspace Cloud**.

- From the Cloud Control Panel, click the **More Products** menu at the top of
  the window and select **Rackspace Intelligence**.
