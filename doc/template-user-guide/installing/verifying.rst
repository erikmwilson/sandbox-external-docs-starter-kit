Verifying
=========

Show how the user can verify that the installation succeeded. If there are
installation test scripts provided with your product, document them here. You
can also show input and output that demonstrates program success.

If verifying is a simple one- or two-step process, you can add the
information to the end of the Deploying section and omit this separate topic.

For an example of a topic that uses this template, see
:ref:`verifying-example-ug`.
