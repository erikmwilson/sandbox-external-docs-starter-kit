Deploying
=========

Document the process of deploying (installing) your product. This
topic should document only the basic installation process; any
additional configuration should go in the Administering section.
Use steps, substeps, and procedures as needed. Show interim
example output if relevant.

Verification of installation success or trial operation is documented
in the ``verifying.rst`` file.

For an example of a topic that uses this template, see
:ref:`deploying-example-ug`.
